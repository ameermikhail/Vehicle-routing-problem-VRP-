### What is the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)?

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a classic optimization problem in which the goal is to determine the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to serve a given set of customers, minimizing total distance traveled or some other cost metric while satisfying various constraints such as vehicle capacity and time windows.

### Features:

- **Efficient Optimization:** Our solution employs cutting-edge optimization techniques to efficiently solve VRP instances, ensuring optimal or near-optimal solutions.

### How to Use:

1. **Input Data:**
   - Prepare your VRP instance data, including the coordinates of customers, demand for each customer, vehicle capacity, and any additional constraints.
   
2. **Run the Solver:**
   - Execute the provided code or script, providing the input data as parameters.
   - Monitor the solver's progress as it finds the optimal or near-optimal solution.

3. **Review Results:**
   - Once the solver completes, review the generated routing solution, including the routes assigned to each vehicle and the total distance traveled.
   - Evaluate the solution's quality and make any necessary adjustments to parameters or input data.

4. **Optimization and Refinement:**
   - Fine-tune parameters or explore alternative solution approaches to further improve solution quality or efficiency.
   
5. **Integration:**
   - Integrate the optimized routing solution into your existing logistics or transportation management system to streamline operations and reduce costs.
